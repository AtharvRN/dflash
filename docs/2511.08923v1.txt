Abstract:Diffusion language models hold the promise of fast parallel generation, while autoregressive (AR)
models typically excel in quality due to their causal structure aligning naturally with language modeling. This
raises a fundamental question: can we achieve a synergy with high throughput, higher GPU utilization, and
AR level quality? Existing methods fail to effectively balance these two aspects, either prioritizing AR using a
weaker model for sequential drafting (speculative decoding), leading to lower drafting efficiency, or using some
form of left-to-right (AR-like) decoding logic for diffusion, which still suffers from quality degradation and
forfeits its potential parallelizability.
We introduce TiDAR, a sequence-level hybrid architecture that drafts tokens (Thinking)inDiffusion and
samples final outputs (Talking)AutoRegressively -all within a single forward pass using specially designed
structured attention masks. This design exploits the free GPU compute density, achieving a strong balance
between drafting and verification capacity. Moreover, TiDAR is designed to be serving-friendly (low overhead)
as a standalone model.
We extensively evaluate TiDAR against AR models, speculative decoding, and diffusion variants across
generative and likelihood tasks at 1.5B and 8B scales. Thanks to the parallel drafting and sampling as well as
exact KV cache support, TiDAR outperforms speculative decoding in measured throughput and surpasses
diffusion models like Dream and Llada in both efficiency and quality. Most notably, TiDAR is the first
architecture to close the quality gap with AR models while delivering 4.71×to 5.91×more tokens per second.
1. Introduction
As we move towards Artificial General Intelligence [1], the remarkable success of large language models
(LLMs) can be largely attributed to their ability to harness the massive computational scaling afforded by the
explosively increasing power of GPUs [2]. So how to make the most of compute resources during both training
and testing times becomes increasingly important. Although autoregressive models [3, 4] are the prevailing
approach, they remain memory-bound during decoding [5, 6] and cannot fully exploit hardware compute
density, particularly at small batch sizes, since they generate only one token per step. In contrast, diffusion
language models (dLMs) [7, 8, 9] offer the promise of parallel token decoding. However, they typically face a
trade-off between quality and parallelizability. In this work, we provide a principled analysis to identify where
these models fall short and propose a simple yet effective hybrid architecture that combines the strengths of
both paradigms.
Decoding in AR models is memory-bound because the latency is dominated by loading the model weights
and KV cache rather than compute [10, 11]. If we can decode multiple tokens in a single forward pass, those
tokens can share the same loaded weights and KV cache, increasing the compute density without increasing
end-to-end latency before transitioning to the compute-bound region. This is precisely why dLMs could provide
potential speedup from a systems perspective. Concretely, given a prefix𝑥<𝑡 and model function𝐹, an AR
model appends a single token slot (last prompt token) and predicts one next token, e.g.,𝑥𝑡+1 := 𝐹([𝑥<𝑡−1; 𝑥𝑡]).
In a masked diffusion model (e.g., Block Diffusion [12] with a simplified one-step denoising scenario), instead
we predict multiple tokens at once,𝑥𝑡+1,...,𝑥 𝑡+𝑘+1 := 𝐹([𝑥<𝑡; 𝑚𝑡+1,...,𝑚 𝑡+𝑘+1])(due to no label shifts).
If for a given𝑘 such that both computations are still memory-bound, the forward time of𝐹([𝑥<𝑡−1; 𝑥𝑡])
and 𝐹([𝑥<𝑡; 𝑚𝑡+1,...,𝑚 𝑡+𝑘+1])should be similar. We refer to the extra token slots(𝑚𝑡+2,...,𝑚 𝑡+𝑘+1)as
free token slotsbecause carrying them through a single forward incurs minimal to no latency increase as
validated by a real-world profiling in Figure 1.
However, a well-known tension between parallel decoding and output quality exists for masked diffusion
models [13, 14]: the best quality is often achieved when decoding strictly one token per denoising step, while

TiDAR: Think in Diffusion, Talk in Autoregression
attempting to exploit within-step parallelism tends to degrade quality. Consequently, current open source
SOTA diffusion LLMs, such as Dream [9] and Llada [8], have not yet matched the combined speed–quality
profile of strong AR LLMs. To formalize their difference from a modeling perspective, AR models sample
from a chain-factorized joint distribution:
𝑝AR(·;𝜃) =
∏︁
𝑖
𝑝𝑖
𝜃(𝑥𝑖|x<𝑖;𝜃).
A diffusion model, on the other hand, samples from the following distribution:
𝑝Diff(·;𝜃) =E ˜x∼𝑞(·|x)
∏︁
𝑖
𝑝𝑖
𝜃(𝑥𝑖|˜x)
Often the quality is best preserved if we choose to decode one token𝑥𝑖 instead of𝑘 tokens {𝑥𝑗,𝑗∈𝐾} per
step because in this case˜x will have the decoded token as a condition for the next denoising step. Decoding𝑘
tokens in one step will further factorize𝑝Diff as a product of marginals:
𝑝Diff_Independent_K(·;𝜃) =E ˜x∼𝑞(·|x)
𝑠.𝑡.˜x𝑖∈𝐾=[𝑚]
∏︁
𝑖∈𝐾
𝑝𝑖
𝜃(𝑥𝑖
𝑡|˜x)
The introduced token independence assumption will degrade the quality despite providing more parallelism
during sampling. The diffusion sampling procedure would fall back to AR if we restrict the order as strict
left-to-right, decode one token per step, and change the masking strategy𝑞(·|x)to uniform suffix masking
during training.
Ideally, we hope to compute with𝑝Diff and leverage its independence assumption for parallel sampling,
but, at the same time, we want to get the quality from𝑝AR due to its aligned casual factorization nature to
language modeling and more context in the condition.
To this end, we propose TiDAR, a new architecture that enables parallel token computation (“thinking”)
from the marginal distribution via diffusion, and high-quality sampling (“talking”) from the chain-factorized
joint distribution via autoregression. Concretely, at each generation step (one forward pass), we partition
tokens into three sections: prefix tokens, tokens proposed in the previous step, and tokens pre-drafted for the
next step. We reuse the KV cache of prefix tokens from the last step. Tokens proposed from the last step are
autoregressively sampled via rejection sampling guided by𝑝AR computed at current step. At the same time,
we pre-draft proposals from the𝑝Diff conditioned on all possible prefix outcomes of the rejection sampling.
One pre-draft proposal will be chosen from them, and passed to the next step. All of these happen in a single
forward pass with a simple and well-designed attention mask. The overhead is almost negligible as long as the
tokens residing in the last two sections can be well fitted into the “free token slots”. Figure 2 illustrates the
architecture in detail.
Training TiDAR is straightforward and data-efficient, as it employs a structured causal–bidirectional
hybrid attention mask over the input sequence, enabling it to learn and sample from𝑝AR and 𝑝Diff within
a single model and foward. Consequently, both autoregressive and diffusion losses can be computed on the
same data sample. During training, all tokens in the diffusion section are set to mask tokens. This simplifies
the masking strategy, strengthens the diffusion loss signal, promotes train-test consistency, and balances the
autoregressive and diffusion objectives.
Our contributions can be summarized as:
• We propose a sequence-level hybrid architecture called TiDAR that utilizes the “free token slots” to
conduct parallel token drafting via diffusion and sampling via autoregression, which combines the speed
and quality advantages from both paradigms.
• We provide a training recipe as well as comprehensive evaluations on both likelihood and generative
downstream tasks to support its superiority over other architectures.
• We conducted detailed ablations to prove the effectiveness of our core design choices and flexibility.
In addition, we analyze TiDAR from the lens of diffusion and speculative decoding, providing a clear
understanding of why our method is appealing.

the same with a certain amount of tokens sent to forward (free + cheap token slots), before transitioning to
the compute-bound regime. We leverage this characteristic to achieve almost free parallelled drafting and
sampling for TiDAR.
• We show that for TiDAR 1.5B, we can achieve lossless quality compared to its AR counterpart while
generating with 4.71×relative throughput (tokens per second) speedup. For TiDAR 8B, we achieved an

TiDAR model is related to and enjoys the benefits of two lines of works: diffusion language models and
speculative decoding. In this section, we connect TiDAR to these two categories and highlight how we
understand TiDAR from different perspectives and how it improves upon prior works.
2.1. Diffusion Language Models
Diffusion language models [21, 22, 8, 9, 12, 7] (dLMs) offer a promising alternative to purely sequential
generation of autoregressive models by allowing parallel generation of multiple tokens at each step, offering a
path towards significant speed-up in generation. Although theoretically appealing, dLLMs face a trade-off
contradiction between parallelizability and generation quality. As exemplified by open-source dLLMs like
Llada [8] and Dream [9], the best generation quality is often achieved when decoding one token at a time (1 token
per model function forward). As reported in APD [17], there is a clear trend of declining generation quality
with increasing number of tokens to generate in parallel per step. Specifically, the accuracy on GSM8K [23]
3

===== PAGE 4 =====
TiDAR: Think in Diffusion, Talk in Autoregression
drops by 10% when increasing from 1 to 2 tokens per step for Dream-7B with the entropy-base sampling
strategy [9]. When decoding multiple tokens per step, dLMs typically sample each token independently from
the marginal distribution, which introduces an intra-step token independence assumption [24] that can hurt
sequence-level coherence and correctness [14]. Recent works have attempted to address the gap between
the generation quality of diffusion models and AR and improve the throughput-quality trade-off. E2D2
[25] adopts an encoder-decoder architecture that enables disaggregating processing FLOPs by token type,
where a large encoder processes clean tokens and a lightweight decoder is tasked with decoding noisy tokens.
EDLM [26] introduces residual energy-based approach to reduce mismatch between training and sampling
distributions, improving generation quality.
Another challenge of scaling up dLM is the lack of support for exact KV caching, as a result of bidirectional
attention. Fast-dLLM [13, 24] proposes to perform block parallel decoding with the prefix and optionally the
suffix being cached during the process of denoising the current block. d-KV cache [27], on the other hand,
takes a more dynamic route by selectively cache certain tokens step by step in a delayed fashion to minimize
quality degradation. Block Diffusion (also known as semi-autoregressive models) [12] attempts to address this
issue by interpolating between discrete diffusion and autoregressive models. Specifically, the model defines an
autoregressive probability distribution across blocks and the conditional probability of tokens within a block
given previous blocks is specified by a denoising discrete diffusion model. Despite being equipped with exact
caching, Block Diffusion still suffers from the same dilemma of quality degradation and intra-block token
parallelizability.
2.2. Speculative Decoding
TiDAR is also closely related to speculative decoding [16], which accelerates generation by first using a
faster draft model to generate a sequence of candidate tokens and then uses a modified rejection sampling
strategy [11] to validate the these tokens against the target distribution of the base model. In order to improve
the speed of drafting, a smaller draft model is usually used. However, if degradation in drafting quality is too
severe, the overall generation speed can be slowed down because of low acceptance rate of draft. In order
to increase both the speed and the quality of drafting, prior works propose to carry the hidden states from
the base model to the drafter. The intuition is that the model’s hidden states (e.g., the second-to-top layer
embedding) carry richer information not only for the next token prediction but also for future tokens. For
example, Medusa [28] adds extra multiple linear decoding heads on the base model’s hidden states to predict
future tokens with an efficient tree verification pattern to expand possible paths. EAGLE series [29, 30, 18]
and DeepSeek-V3 Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) [19] use additional autoregressive layers on the base model’s
hidden states to predict future tokens. However, the drafting process does not fully take advantage of the
base model, and the maximal speedup is hindered by the lower drafter capacity. In addition, EAGLE and
DeepSeek-V3’s MTP modules are still autoregressive and sequential to the base verification. These two factors
show that they cannot effectively increase the compute density and release the full power of parallel generation.
If we view TiDAR from the perspective of speculative decoding (summarized comparison in Table 1),
one of the main advantages of TiDAR is that it only has a single model and can complete both the drafting
and sampling simultaneously in a single forward pass. This induces three merits: 1) The draft model is the
base model itself, so it has high capacity by reusing the base model’s weights and compute. 2) The drafting
process follows a diffusion approach, allowing it to be fully parallelized. This means it can utilize the full
computational power across all input mask tokens, rather than being limited to only the last token as in
autoregressive MTP methods. 3) The drafting and verification processes are parallelized in a single forward
pass, which further eliminates the overhead of sequential drafting and verification.
3. Method
In this section, we describe the proposed architecture TiDAR, starting from training the backbone that
enables modeling both the joint distribution (i.e., AR mode) and the marginal distribution (i.e., diffusion
mode) in a single model and a single model forward. We then elaborate how we use the dual modes for
paralleled self-speculative generation, allowing the model to draft (“thinking”) in diffusion for efficiency and
sample (“talking”) in autoregression for quality. Finally, we conclude by discussing the training and inference
optimizations.

last step and pre-draft tokens for the next step in parallel. By switching the attention pattern among different
parts of the sequence, TiDAR encodes the clean tokens drafted from last step causally and mask tokens
block-causally (bidirectional within each block) for one-step diffusion pre-drafting. Upon accepting a prefix,
the corresponding pre-drafts (proposal) can be selected. The KV cache for tokens forwarded causally will be
stored and later evicted if the corresponding tokens are rejected. We illustrate this with a draft length of 3
and an accepted length of 2. Figure 3 shows the exact decoding mask for this example.

Figure 3 |TiDAR Attention Masks:(Left) We apply a special training mask (using block length =
3): mask tokens of the same length are appended to the input tokens where the clean input tokens are
self-attended causally and mask tokens within-block bidirectionally along with the prefix. During inference
parallel decoding, we use a slice of a pre-initialized mask based on the prefix of the current step (Right). To
reuse the mask, we reorder the sampling-draft part (tokens drafted from last step and mask positions for next
step pre-drafting) and the clean prefix as illustrated with an example prefix length of 3.
3.1. Diffusion-AR Dual-mode Backbone Training
Our goal is to train a model that enables the diffusion and AR dual modes. More importantly, we want to
have the dual modes happening in a single model forward in order to exploit the “free token slots”. To achieve
this, sequence level casual and bidirectional attention hybridization becomes most natural choice. A similar
idea has been explored in the context of Block Diffusion models [12]; however, their primary objective is not
to support dual-mode operation, but rather to enable KV caching and improve generation quality specifically
for the diffusion component. The resulting attention mask of Block Diffusion is intra-block bidirectional and
inter-block causal. We make a modification to Block Diffusion by only preserving the last block, which is
the decoding block, to be bidirectional and the rest (i.e. prefix) to be causal. The benefits of doing so are
two-folds. First, it allows us to compute the chain-factorized joint distribution just like in AR models. This,
as we will show in Section 3.2, will allow us to conduct rejection sampling using the joint distribution with
high quality guarantee and evaluate likelihood the same way as AR in terms of efficiency (Section 4.2.2).
Second, computing next token prediction (NTP) loss on the prefix becomes possible during model pre-training
5

===== PAGE 6 =====
TiDAR: Think in Diffusion, Talk in Autoregression
and finetuning [31]. Note that Block Diffusion cannot compute this loss on the prefix because of the label
leakage issue of intra-block bidirectional attention. In addition, the NTP signal is much denser than pure
diffusion loss since the latter is only applied to the mask tokens. In our model training, we can leverage the
two types of losses simultaneously to better utilize the training data.
In Figure 3 (Left), we visualize the attention masked during training. Similar to Block Diffusion [12] and
Set Block Decoding (SBD) [31], we also need to double the sequence length, as a result of appending original
input sequence with corrupted tokens. For the causal (autoregressive) section, the target labels are shifted by
one position to match NTP objective, while for the bidirectional (diffusion) section, the labels remain aligned
with their input positions. For the diffusion part, Block Diffusion [12] and SBD [31] add noise to the input
sequence by applying random masks sampled from a special distribution, following the traditional diffusion
language modeling approaches [8, 9, 32].
We propose a simpler and more effective training strategy by setting all tokens in the diffusion section to
mask tokens. This eliminates the hassle of deciding the optimal masking strategy. And more importantly, it
allows us to compute the loss for every token in the diffusion part, resulting in three key benefits: (1) The
diffusion loss becomes much denser compared to only corrupted tokens like before. (2) Balancing the diffusion
loss with the NTP loss becomes much simpler. In traditional diffusion approaches, the number of loss terms
varies across samples depending on how many tokens are masked, whereas the next-token prediction loss
is always calculated over the same number of tokens. This mismatch makes it difficult to balance the two
losses. By masking all tokens, the number of loss terms is consistent across both types of losses (equal to the
sequence length), allowing straightforward balancing using a user-defined weighting factor. (3) It allows us
to do one-step diffusion during inference, which makes the drafting process more efficient than multi-step
denoising. We detail this with ablation studies in Section 4.4.4.
Therefore, the training objective of TiDAR is simplified as:

where 𝛼∈ [0,1]is the loss balancing factor,{𝑥𝑖}𝑆 is the input sequence with length𝑆, andℒ𝐴𝑅,ℒ𝐷𝑖𝑓𝑓 are
cross-entropy losses with logits calculated at clean and masked sequences using different attention patterns.
3.2. Fully Parallelizable Self-Speculative Generation
Reasoning the generation efficiency of a model requires considering many aspects: the number of forward steps
in total, the number of decoded (or sampled) tokens per step, as well as the latency per step. Many existing
techniques falling in the category of diffusion language models [8, 9, 17], MTP [33, 28, 19], and speculative
decoding [11, 29] are trying to optimize some of them. However, the result is often a trade-off among latency,
quality, and compute density. In this work, we attempt to provide an answer to this global optimization
problem by incorporating the diffusion parallelism and AR quality into a single model.
We propose a parallel drafting and sampling procedure. The method centers around the speculative
framework where the model first drafts speculative tokens in parallel from the marginal distribution, which
are then rejectively sampled in an autoregressive manner to secure generative quality. In the start of the
generation, the model encodes prompt causually and drafts a block of tokens in parallel with a bidirectional
attention (mask illustrated in Appendix Figure 7). In the each subsequent decoding step, draft tokens from
the last step are rejectively sampled by checking whether they match the prediction from the autoregressive
joint distribution computed at current step using causal attention. In the same time, inspired by Apple’s
MTP work [20], we also pre-draft the next step’s tokens in parallel from the marginal distribution using
bidirectional attention, conditioned on all possible outcomes of the rejection sampling. So that no matter how
many tokens we accept at the current step, we would be able to get the corresponding drafts for the next step.
In Figure 2, we illustrate the generation process.

Figure 4|Efficiency-Quality Benchmarking:We compare TiDAR on 1.5B and 8B with AR, AR with
speculative decoding (EAGLE-3), and Block Diffusion. Points colored the same indicate the same model
sizes while markers suggest different methods. On the y-axis we have individual task scores. On the x-axis,
we showcase the relative decoding throughput speedup measured in tokens per second, with the baseline
being the AR model within the same size group (Qwen2.5 1.5B Base, Qwen3 8B Base and Qwen3 8B
Instruct). On top of each point, we report the average tokens per NFE. For 1.5B models, we showcase two and
three different settings for Block Diffusion (threshold = max, 0.8, illustrated from left to right) and TiDAR
(training block size = 4, 8, 16, illustrated from left to right) respectively.
To further improve the efficiency, we adopt a one-step diffusion drafting [34]. We found one step is sufficient
to produce draft tokens whose quality is good enough to secure high acceptance rate. Correspondingly, we set
all tokens in the diffusion section to masks during training as discussed in the above Section 3.1.
3.3. Training and Inference Optimization
As we discuss in Section 3.1, our corrupted sequence is fully masked, which makes loss balancing easier due to
the equal variance of the loss scale calculated from the AR and diffusion logits. We choose to set𝛼= 1for
most cases and ablate the difference of different𝛼values in Section 4.4.3.
During inference, we leverage the fact that the number of tokens we send to the model in each forward is
the same and has the same attention pattern, we reorder the draft part and prefix so that we can initialize one
block attention mask of size (q_len1, q_len + max_sequence_len) and slice the cached mask for each step
without recomputing it for Flex Attention [35] (Figure 3 (Right)). Different from traditional diffusion models,
TiDAR supports exact KV cache like Block Diffusion. In Figure 2, we showcase the generative process where
we first save all the KV cache of tokens which are computed with causal attention, and later on, evict the KV
cache if our sampling length is shorter than the draft length. It is worth mentioning that we do not waste
any computation by recomputing the KV cache of any token, which makes our method extremely efficient
compared to Block Diffusion, SBD, and the cache methods used in pure diffusion (e.g. Fast-dLLMs [13, 24]
and d-KV Cache [27]).
Unlike traditional diffusion models, TiDAR has no hyperparameters to tune during inference. But still, we
provide some flexibility to accomondate different scenarios as detailed in Section 4.4.2 and 4.4.3.

4. Experiments
4.1. Setup
Model initialization and tasksIn this paper, we focus on the setting of continual pretraining from AR
models (Qwen2.5 1.5B [36], Qwen3 4B, and Qwen3 8B [37]). We include quality evaluations on generative
and likelihood tasks, including coding (HumanEval, HumanEval+, MBPP, and MBPP+), math (GSM8K
and Minerva Math), factual knowledge (MMLU), and commonsense reasoning (ARC, Hellaswag, PIQA, and
Winogrande). We uselm_eval_harness[ 38] for all evaluation. The detailed task configurations can
be found in the Appendix A. In terms of efficiency, we report the average number of tokens a single model
forward (or network function evaluation, NFE for short) can produce, as well as wall-block speedup in terms
of token per wall-clock second under the batch size of one.
BaselineWe include open-sourced AR models such as Llama3.2 [39], SmolLM2 [40], Qwen2.5 [36], and
Qwen3 [37] with similar model sizes. For diffusion models, we compare ours against Dream [9] and Llada [8],
as well as our trained Block Diffusion [12] under the same training recipe.For all Qwen2.5 and Qwen3 models,
the results are referring to the base model unless explicitly specified.
Training and inferenceFor TiDAR 1.5B model, we continually pretrain with 50B tokens on Nvidia H100s
with a global batch size of 2M tokens (DDP) under block sizes of 4, 8, and 16. For the 8B model, we use
150B tokens instead, with a block size of 16, keeping the rest of the settings the same. We adopt the cosine
scheduling with𝑚𝑎𝑥_𝑙𝑟= 1𝑒−5,𝑚𝑖𝑛_𝑙𝑟 = 3𝑒−6and a warm-up step fraction of1%. The max sequence
length is set to 4096 with distributed Adam [41] optimizer and we turn on gradient checkpointing for the 8B
model. The overall training framework is a modified Megatron-LM [42] with Torchtitan [43] support. Both
training and inference are conducted in the standard BFloat 16 precision. In terms of the main results, we
report the performance for TiDAR 1.5B and TiDAR 8B and focus on the use of 1.5B for ablation studies.
4.2. Main Results
4.2.1. Generative Task Evaluation
In this section, we start off by investigating the ability of TiDAR to generate high-quality samples efficiently.
We focus on coding and math tasks since their metrics are much more robust. In Table 2, we first compare
TiDAR against several AR models and also a popular diffusion variant, Block Diffusion, across two model
sizes.
For 1.5B-1.7B size range, TiDAR is highly competitive in terms of quality with an average 7.45 tokens per
model forward (NFE). For 8B models, TiDAR incurs very minimal loss with a simple training recipe while
increasing the generation efficiency to 8.25 tokens per NFE. We also tested two different modes of generation,
namely “trusting AR” v.s. “trusting diffusion”, which shows that for larger models, trusting the predictions
from diffusion predictions is beneficial in most cases, especially for math tasks. We will discuss the choice
difference more in Section 4.4.3.
Comparing with diffusion LLMs, TiDAR outperforms both public models like Dream and Llada consistently,
and also our own Block Diffusion with the same training recipe. Here, we decode one token per NFE since
this very often guarantees the best achievable quality for most tasks. We defer the discussion and comparison
of different decoding strategies to Section 4.4.2.
In summary, TiDAR strikes a nice balance between generative quality and efficiency due to several designs
we mentioned above, making it a highly appealing choice for many critical application scenarios with a
stringent latency requirement.
4.2.2. Likelihood Task Evaluation
Evaluating model performance based on likelihood for traditional diffusion LLMs (e.g. LLaDA, Dream,
MDLM) has been very challenging due to various ways of computing the likelihood. For example, response
tokens will be corrupted in the same way as training, and the likelihood is calculated only on the masked

positions [8], which are averaged over Monte Carlo sample budgets. Although agreement has been achieved on
the use of likelihood for multiple-choice questions despite being less efficient, directly comparing models using
this metric still remains a subject of debate. TiDAR, on the other hand, alleviates this problem due to the
fact that its AR mode naturally supports computing the likelihood in the same way as autoregressive models.
We show in Table 3 that 1) this approach is highly aligned with other AR LLMs, making it highly comparable,
2) its performance is competitive and faithful to generative quality (due to autoregressive sampling), and 3)
the evaluation is extremely efficient with a single NFE.
4.3. Efficiency Benchmarking
Finally, we conclude the main results with a focus on benchmarking the wall-clock time of TiDAR against AR,
AR with EAGLE-32 for speculative decoding, and Block Diffusion. We choose these since they are among
the most competitive choices across standard autoregressive decoding, speculative decoding, and diffusion
generations. All of the models have the exact cache supported and are benchmarked on a single H100 GPU
with prompts from downstream generative tasks and a batch size equal to 1.
In Figure 4, we show that TiDAR 1.5B can achieve an average of 4.71x relative speedup to Qwen2.5 1.5B
in terms of decoding throughput and TiDAR 8B with an average of 5.91x over Qwen3 8B while maintaining
comparable performances. Comparing with Block Diffusion with two settings using different thresholds, we
can also achieve better efficiency-quality trade-offs in all tasks we tested. In terms of the SOTA speculative
decoding method, EAGLE-3 [18], we test TiDAR against public weights from AngelSlim3 and Tengyunw4,
in which we show for the first time that diffusion models can surpass the efficiency gains over speculative
decoding. However, we want to emphasize that speculative decoding and our methods should be utilized
with different purposes since the former is able to guarantee exactly the same output as the base model. In
addition, we show that our raw acceptance rate (T/NFE) is higher than those of EAGLE-3 open weights, and
more importantly, our conversion rate (from T/NFE to T/s) is higher, thanks to the parallel drafting and
sampling with a single model forward.
It is worth noting that all of these methods can significantly benefit from further system optimizations
such as custom kernels, more efficient KV cache management, and request scheduling. Hence, the goal here is

to provide a first-hand idea of their performance in native PyTorch.
4.4. Ablation Studies
The objective of this section is to understand more deeply where the performance gains come from and justify
the design choices of our architecture, training, and inference.
4.4.1. Pareto Frontier under the Same Training Recipe
The quality and training recipe can drastically impact the performance of LLMs. Therefore, to fairly compare
different model architectures, we train all models using the same setting starting from Qwen2.5 1.5B models.
In Figure 5, the Pareto Frontier of these trained models provides insight into how TiDAR performs against
the base AR, Block Diffusion, and fine-tuned AR models. We can see that with only 50B training tokens,
TiDAR can achieve impressive quality while maintaining a high T/NFE compared with Block Diffusion with
different thresholds used for parallel decoding. We also notice the remaining quality gap from the fine-tuned
AR models, which we believe could be potentially closed with more data due to the fact that TiDAR might
require a bit more knowledge due to the initial adaptation phase.
4.4.2. Comparing TiDAR with Other Decoding Strategy
Common strategies used in dLMs include generating a fixed number of tokens per NFE [8], dynamic number
of NFEs based on entropy [9] or confidence-based decoding [13], and also within-block left-to-right decoding.
Many prior works have studied the benefits of these and, here, we provide a comprehensive comparison
in Table 4 against our method. We demonstrate that our method leverages both the efficient parallelism
from diffusion but also high quality from autoregression, with an added benefit of not requiring to tune any
hyperparameters during decoding.
4.4.3. Sampling with AR v.s. Diffusion Prediction
As shown in Figure 2, using no label shifts for the diffusion part makes it possible to pre-draft without waiting
for AR’s results at the same step while keeping the sequence consistent (i.e. the first mask would predict
𝐹′′instead without knowing the actual value of𝐸 when it is label shifted, which will degrade the quality).
However, this comes at the cost that the AR outputs and every first position in the block will be predicting

the same position (e.g.𝐸 to 𝐸′′, 𝐹′to 𝐹′′, 𝐺′to 𝐺′′), leading to a potential decision of choosing what to use
for verification.
Therefore, we propose to apply an aggregate function to mix their logits before sampling the token as
arg max𝑖{𝛽*𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑖𝑡𝑠 𝑎𝑟
𝑖 + (1−𝛽) *𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑖𝑡𝑠𝑑𝑖𝑓𝑓
𝑖 ,𝑖∈|𝑉|} , which then gets compared against the proposed draft
token. This can also be understood as whether we “trust” the AR or the diffusion outputs more when it
comes to sampling.
In Figure 6, we vary the value of𝛽 (over different loss balancing factor𝛼) and see consistent performance.
This shows that our model is well trained so that no matter what logits we choose to use for verification,
the quality is preserved because in the ideal case (i.e. well-trained), these two outputs will be strictly the
same. This also indicates that it is the autoregressive rejection sampling that guarantees the quality-speedup
trade-offs rather than the AR knowledge.
4.4.4. How Useful is the Full Mask Strategy?
To take advantage of the fact that the model does not see partial clean inputs during inference due to one-step
diffusion drafting, we corrupt the inputs to the diffusion part to be full masks during training. This not only

promotes better train-test behavior consistency but also provides richer diffusion loss signals and easier loss
balancing after normalization. In Table 5, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this masking strategy, which
shows a consistent quality improvement especially in coding tasks. We also want to note that this enables the
flexibility of deciding which module’s predictions to trust for autoregressive rejection sampling as discussed in
Section 4.4.3.

5. Limitations
Batch sizeAlthough we focus on batch size = 1 efficiency benchmarking, it does not mean that TiDAR
cannot handle large batch size. Not only can we adjust the block (draft) length during decoding in a zero-shot
manner to accommodate different compute profile, but also can achieve competitive performance in terms of
FLOPs / token.
Long context extensionWe believe that our model is not intrinsically limited in long context capability
compared to standard AR models. Since our current implementation requires doubling the sequence length
with appended mask tokens during training, we defer the exploration of efficient long context extension
methods (e.g. context parallelism specifically designed for TiDAR) for future work.
System optimizationWe show that even writing in native PyTorch with Flex Attention, we have already
achieved substantial throughput improvement. We believe that writing custom attention kernels and scheduling
algorithms can maximize the use of the “free token slots” specific to the serving hardware in use as shown in
Figure 1.

6. Conclusions
We introduce TiDAR, a sequence-level hybrid architecture that drafts (thinks) in diffusion and samples (talks)
in autoregression in a single model forward with a specially designed attention mask. Taking advantage of the
efficiency gains from parallel one-step diffusion and the quality guaranteed by autoregressive sampling, TiDAR
achieves impressive efficiency and quality trade-offs. We show in a diverse set of downstream tasks that
TiDAR 1.5B and 8B models can output with an average of 7.45 and 8.25 tokens per NFE, which translates to
4.71×and5 .91×more tokens per second compared to AR while maintaining competitive quality. We push
the limit of “free token slots” on modern GPUs and, for the first time, show it is possible to beat speculative
decoding for latency-critical applications. We believe that this will significantly motivate future research on
hybrid LLM architecture and inference.

Table 6|Benchmark Configuration for All Tasks
In Tab. 6, we detail the benchmarking configuration, including the number of few-shot prompts, generation
length and performance metric, for each of tasks we adopted in the work. For HumanEval and HumanEval
Plus, we apply standard post-processing for the all models. Thelm_eval_harnessversion we use is 0.4.8.
B. Inference Prefill Mask
We apply the same technique of reusing the initialized attention mask for different prompt lengths across
samples. This is achieved by reordering different parts of the input and slicing the big mask. The mask is
illustrated in Figure 7.
